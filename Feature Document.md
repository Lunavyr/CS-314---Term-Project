### Product Vision
Describe the product vision using Moore’s vision template. lecture slides Chapter 1 p12-
16 (You can read product vision of slack: https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-
saddles-here-4c59524d650d#Web_Advice%7Ckromodor or choose your own favorites)

### Product Scope
Describe all the features of this product using a mind map here. You can use existing
instant messaging application as an inspiration. Please be as specific as you can. This
mind map should be one of your main references when actually designing sprint backlog.

### Operating Environment
Describe the operating environment this product requires.
2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
When considering implementing all the features in 2.2, what are the languages, libraries,
frameworks or platforms you are going to use? Describe the constraints you might have
when designing and implementing the product using these tools.



## User Stories
Describe the purpose of this section. Why is it necessary to understand users’ needs when
developing product? How many efforts should be made?

### Personas
Provide at least three target user personas (lecture slides Chapter 3 p8-16) of this product.
(2.1 product vision may help you)

### User Scenarios
Write user scenarios (Chapter 3 p17-25) from the personas you wrote in 3.1.
#### <User Scenarios with Persona 1>
You should stand on the same side with the persona you created. Several scenarios
should be derived from one persona. Scenarios should be general with no implementation
details.
#### <User Scenarios with Persona 2>
#### <User Scenarios with Persona 3>

### Epic User Stories
Write at least three epic (Chapter 3 p28 3rd bullet point) user stories (Chapter 3 p27-29)
with acceptance criteria in the following template. Try to define each small user story
specifically so that they could directly be used in the sprint backlog.
#### <Epic User Stories 1>
<Lastname> 5
Epic 1: (title)
As a <type of user>
I want to <perform some task><including multiple connected features or one very
complex feature>
So that I can <achieve some goal>
Acceptance Criteria
Give <some condition>
When <some action is triggered>
Then <some desired outcome would occur>
<Breakdown the features to a single feature that can be implemented in a sprint>
User story 1:
As a <type of user> ...
User story 2:
As a <type of user> ...
User story 3:
As a <type of user> ...
#### <Epic User Stories 2>
#### <Epic User Stories 3>



## Feature List
Describe the overview of all the features in your product. And also provide a thorough
feature list (Chapter 3 p45-47) out of ALL the features you are going to implement. You
could sort this list with the highest priority and lowest effort first. This list would be your
most important reference when setting up sprint backlog.

1. Authentication (reg, login/out, etc)
2. Create a chatroom with a group of users
3. Chatting in said chatroom
4. Display all chatrooms
5. Delete a chatroom
6. Proper database storage for the following: user info, contacts, and message history





## Thoughts/Ideas (Feel free to add or expand on ideas here!)
* I think first, we should take next week to formalize our approach and research the frameworks we need.

* The project can probably be easilly broken up into chunks.
  For instance, we could probably start by one of us making the front end with React, and another the data structures and methods that underlie it with Node.js.
  Then we can move on to linking it to a database with Express and Mongo.

* As outlined in the description for this assignment, I think we should focus on the beginning how we could apply agile development techniques in our project.

* Additionally, despite the fact that nobody is likely to ever use this program, we should try to maintain a focus on security throughout the development cycles.
