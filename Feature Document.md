## Thoughts/Ideas (Feel free to add or expand on ideas here!)
* I think first, we should take next week to formalize our approach and research the frameworks we need.

* The project can probably be easilly broken up into chunks.
  For instance, we could probably start by one of us making the front end with React, and another the data structures and methods that underlie it with Node.js.
  Then we can move on to linking it to a database with Express and Mongo.

* As outlined in the description for this assignment, I think we should focus on the beginning how we could apply agile development techniques in our project.

* Additionally, despite the fact that nobody is likely to ever use this program, we should try to maintain a focus on security throughout the development cycles.
