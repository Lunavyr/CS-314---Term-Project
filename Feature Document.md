# Feature Document/Sprint Backlog

## Feature List
Describe the overview of all the features in your product. And also provide a thorough
feature list (Chapter 3 p45-47) out of ALL the features you are going to implement. You
could sort this list with the highest priority and lowest effort first. This list would be your
most important reference when setting up sprint backlog.

1. Account Creation
2. Authentication (reg, login/out, etc).
3. Create individual and send messages back and forth between users.
4. Create a chatroom with a group of users - likely requires functionality from #3.
5. Display chat history.
6. Display all chatrooms (either in a scrollable or collapsible field).
7. Delete a chatroom.
8. Proper database storage/hosting for the following: user info, contacts, and message history.

###Non-required features
1. Define user priviledge (will allow for moderation of groupchats and for non-owners to delete chatroom).
2. Allow users to leave groupchats (or perhaps change the initial behavior to invitation instead of automatic admission).
3. Search within chat history for with a search string.
