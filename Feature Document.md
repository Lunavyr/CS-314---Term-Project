## Thoughts/Ideas
* I think first, we should take next week to formalize our approach and research the frameworks we need.

* The project can probably be easilly broken up into chunks.
  For instance, we could probably start by one of us making the front end with React, and another the data structures and methods that underlie it with Node.js.
  Then we can move on to linking it to a database with Express and Mongo.

* We should definitely follow the agile development process for this project.
