## User guide:



### Installation
* Clone Repository to local system (use the 'Code' tab in the root directory). 
* Change "MONGO_URI" variable in the ".env" file located in the "/Chat Appliction (GooberChat)" directory to a database with which your IP is associated.
* (*Optional): Change "PORT" and "JWT_KEY" to different values per your own preference.



### Use
Backend:
* While your terminal is currently in "~/Chat Application (GooberChat)" - run "npm start"

Frontend:
* Change to the Frontend directory (cd Frontend) - run "npm start"
  
System:
* Upon successful start of the front, a tab in your web browser should open. If not then simply go to "localhost:${PORT}/" where PORT is your selected port.
* The application should now be up and running. Use to your hearts content!

<br><br>Deployment:
* We have also been unsuccessful in our attempts at full deployment via the website integration of this github page using Heroku (PaaS). CLI deployment might be possible while inside the "Chat Application (GooberChat)" folder.
